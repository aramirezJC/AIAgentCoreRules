# Testing Rules

> Load when: writing or modifying any test code.
> Rules are project-agnostic. Verify that any project-specific utility exists in the codebase before using it.

---

## Container Setup

```yaml
di_container:
  create:   "Services.CreateNewService(null)"  # creates a proper container
  avoid:    "Services.Instance = null"         # does NOT create a proper container
  teardown: "Services.Instance.Dispose()"
```

Always bind a real message bus implementation — substitutes break any code path that dispatches messages.

---

## Test Doubles

```yaml
use_real_or_project_dummy_when:
  - Behavior under realistic conditions must be verified.
  - The code path dispatches messages.
  - The project provides a Dummy for the interface.

use_substitute_when:
  - Specific return values must be configured.
  - Calls must be verified.
  - No project Dummy exists for the interface.

never_substitute:
  - IMessageBus, IMessageDispatcher, IBlackboard — always bind a real MessageManager.
```

---

## Assertions

```yaml
assertion_priority:
  first:    Project aggregator if available — verify it exists before importing.
  fallback: Standard framework assertions (NUnit Assert, etc.)

aggregator_rules:
  - Aggregate all failures — do not short-circuit on first failure.
  - Always provide a descriptive failure message — the aggregator reports only the message.
  - Reference types: reference equality. Structs: value equality.
```

---

## State Reset

```yaml
teardown_requirements:
  - Every SetUp must have a matching TearDown.
  - Recreate or reset all mocks and test doubles per test — never share state between tests.
  - ScriptableObject instances: destroy via Object.DestroyImmediate().
  - "[RES] DI containers: dispose in TearDown."
```

---

## Async

```yaml
async_rules:
  - Prefer Task-returning test methods over async void.
  - Never use DateTime.Now — inject and mock ITimeService or equivalent.
```

---

## Naming

```yaml
test_method_pattern: "{TestedBehavior}_{Condition}_{ExpectedResult}"
examples:
  - CanStartEvent_WhenAlreadyInProgress_ReturnsFalse
  - ProcessPrize_WithMemoryFlag_CallsPrizeProcess
```

---

## Idle Behavior & Polling

Event listeners and poll-based update handlers must be verified not just immediately after an action (single snapshot) but also at idle with no data change.

```yaml
idle_behavior_rules:
  - "Verify that poll handlers, event listeners, and state-update subscriptions do not cause unnecessary recomputation, re-rendering, or DOM mutations when data has not changed."
  - "Include at least one idle fixture: render/initialize, tick N times with no data change, assert state remains unchanged (no re-wrapping of highlights, no redundant repaints, no spurious re-renders)."
  - "Example: a subscription that rebuilds the entire UI tree on every poll tick regardless of data change will fail this test when the tree is rendered twice and compared unchanged."
  - "This catches bugs that snapshot tests (verify-after-action) miss: redundant rebuilds, races between competing update paths, frame-to-frame accumulation of DOM mutations."
```

**Rationale:** Unit tests typically verify behavior immediately after an action (single snapshot in time), which misses steady-state defects only visible across multiple ticks at idle or under repeated updates with no data change.
