# Unity Tools

Scripts in `Tools/unity-tools/` that the agent — or anyone — runs against a Unity host project
instead of rebuilding the same analysis by hand. The agent is told to **run these, not
reimplement them**. They ship with the core rules; a host project routes to them from the
"Runnable Tools" section of its SystemIndex (see [[10_HostProjectLayer|Host Project Layer]]).

A script belongs here only if it verifies work, or performs a structured analysis that would
otherwise take many exploratory greps. Every script:

- runs on stock `python3` with no third-party packages,
- finds the project root itself (walking up to `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`; override
  with `--project`),
- prints only what the caller needs — quiet on success,
- exits non-zero on failure, so it works in a hook or CI step,
- never writes into `Assets/`, and is safe to run with the Unity Editor open.

## Which one do I want?

| Question | Tool |
|---|---|
| Does my change compile? | `typecheck.py` |
| What does this type look like / who implements it? | `codeindex.py` |
| Who *calls* this member? | `usages.py` |
| What does this *Unity engine* API really do? | `unitysource.py` |

`codeindex.py` knows declarations, not call sites. `usages.py` knows call sites, but lexically.
`typecheck.py` is the only authoritative one.

## typecheck.py

Verifies a change compiles without launching Unity, using Unity's bundled Roslyn compiler and
reporting only errors. A full project check takes roughly 7 seconds.

```bash
python3 typecheck.py                     # changed assemblies + everything referencing them
python3 typecheck.py Assembly-CSharp     # named assemblies + their dependents
python3 typecheck.py --all
python3 typecheck.py --changed --base develop
python3 typecheck.py --list              # show the plan, compile nothing
python3 typecheck.py --include-new       # also compile new .cs files not yet in a .csproj
python3 typecheck.py Assembly-CSharp-Editor --define USING_TOOLS   # code behind a define that is off
```

- **Dependents are checked automatically.** Changing an interface in a low-level assembly pulls
  in everything that references it, built in dependency order.
- **A failed dependency marks its dependents `skip`, not `ok`.** Silence is not success.
- **New files need a Unity refresh** (or `--include-new`) — a file not yet in a `.csproj` is not
  compiled, and the script says so. `--include-new` only picks up files git reports as changed: a
  new `.cs` file in a gitignored folder (such as `Assets/GitIgnoreAssets/`) is not compiled, so
  its types show as CS0246, until Unity regenerates the `.csproj` (focus the Editor once).
- **Code behind an `#if` symbol that is off** is compiled out and reports clean. Pass
  `--define SYMBOL` to include it.
- **Git worktrees work without setup.** Run the script from inside the worktree, by the main
  checkout's absolute path and without `--project`. It compiles the worktree's files against
  the main checkout's `.csproj` files and `Library/`, and picks up files added in the
  worktree. Passing `--project` for another checkout compiles that checkout instead, and the
  script warns about it. An `.asmdef` added in the worktree is referenced from
  `Assembly-CSharp` / `Assembly-CSharp-Editor` when it is `autoReferenced` and the main
  checkout has its `.csproj`. If there is no `.csproj`, the script warns: CS0246 errors for
  its types are false — let Unity refresh the main checkout on the branch. A `references`
  entry added to an existing `.asmdef` is not in the main checkout's `.csproj` either:
  CS0246/CS0234 for the newly referenced assembly's types in that assembly are false until
  Unity regenerates the project files (after landing). The script warns naming each pair.
- It is a type check, not a build: it catches signature and reference breakage, not broken
  `[SerializeField]` wiring or missing assets.

The agent must run it before reporting any multi-file C# change as complete, and at the start
and end of a session. Reading `Editor.log` is not a substitute — it is large and usually stale.

## codeindex.py

A SQLite index of every type and member declaration (about 5,400 files, 7,300 types and 71,000
members), so relationship questions are answered without reading files.

```bash
python3 codeindex.py implementers IEventManager
python3 codeindex.py subclasses Screen                        # transitive
python3 codeindex.py members DummyEventManager --kind method
python3 codeindex.py bases GemEventManager
python3 codeindex.py where IEventQuery
python3 codeindex.py types --assembly Assembly-CSharp --kind interface
python3 codeindex.py sql "SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM base_ref GROUP BY name"
python3 codeindex.py schema                   # tables + example queries
```

- **Always fresh.** Every query refreshes the index first if anything changed, including files
  Unity has never seen. No manual rebuild is needed.
- Stored at `Library/codeindex.sqlite` (git-ignored, outside `Assets/`). `--json` works on any
  query.
- **Git worktrees work without setup.** Run it from inside the worktree without `--project`; it
  indexes the worktree's files with the main checkout's `.csproj` files and keeps its own
  database in the worktree's `Library/`.
- Files not compiled for the current build target are indexed but marked; `--compiled-only`
  excludes them.
- **Limits:** base types match by simple name, so same-named types in different namespaces can
  collide. All `#if` branches are indexed, so it answers "what exists in source", not "what
  exists in an RC build".
- **Gotchas:** `--no-auto-build` on a stale index exits with "Index is stale…" rather than
  serving the last build — use `sql` on a copy of the database for a snapshot. `build --force`
  re-inserts every row, so `type.id` / `member.id` change across builds; key anything
  persistent by name, not id.

## usages.py

Answers "who uses this type, and which of them call the members I want to move out?" — the
question behind any interface split.

```bash
python3 usages.py IEventManager
python3 usages.py IEventManager --members FetchEvents,FetchEvent,RefreshEventStatus
python3 usages.py IPrizeManager --assembly Assembly-CSharp --full
```

Output has three groups: declares/implements, calls to the named members (with line numbers),
and everything else (summarised per assembly unless `--full`).

- **Lexical, not semantic.** A local method with the same name shows up as a call. Use it to
  narrow the files worth reading, then confirm with `typecheck.py`.
- **Events are missed.** Event members are used as `Member +=` / `Member -=`, which never match.
  Grep for those instead.
- Only files in a generated `.csproj` are searched.

## unitysource.py

Shows the decompiled source of the Unity engine's own managed code (`UnityEngine.*` and
`UnityEditor.*`) for the project's Unity version. Use it when the question is about the engine
rather than our code, for example whether a getter copies a value or wraps native memory. That
was the DT-20157 root cause.

```bash
python3 $R/unitysource.py where MinMaxGradientBlittable      # which module declares it
python3 $R/unitysource.py show Gradient                      # outline, one line per member
python3 $R/unitysource.py show Gradient --member Gradient    # full bodies of the named members
python3 $R/unitysource.py grep "new Gradient\(" -C 2         # search what is cached so far
```

- **The cache grows as you ask.** There's no full pass. Each lookup lists modules only until it
  finds the type, and decompiles only the type you show (or a whole module with `module`).
  Everything is cached in `~/Library/Caches/UnityDecompiled/<version>/`, outside the repos. The
  cache never goes stale; a Unity upgrade starts a new folder.
- **Needs `ilspycmd`** (`dotnet tool install -g ilspycmd`). The script sets
  `DOTNET_ROOT=~/.dotnet` itself.
- **Managed code only.** Native behaviour isn't visible, so confirm what you find on the real
  object in the Editor.

## Orphaned .csproj files

Unity leaves project files behind when an assembly is renamed or removed; this project has
about 26 from 2023–24. Both `typecheck.py` and `usages.py` detect and ignore them;
`typecheck.py --verbose` lists them.

A second kind is not detected: `.csproj` files Unity stopped regenerating (here 6 dated
2026-09-17 — Adjust, Disney.RainbowCore.Environment.Android/iOS,
Disney.RainbowCore.SignInWithGoogle.Android/iOS, JamCity.InboxSdk.Editor). Their hint paths
still resolve, so they count as live, but their ProjectReferences are not maintained. A check
that compares `.asmdef` references to `.csproj` must limit itself to `.asmdef` files changed
since the last sync, as `missing_asmdef_references` does.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s Tools/unity-tools/tests -p 'test_*.py'
```
