# AI Agent Processes — Overview

This space documents **AIAgentCoreRules**, the portable framework we use to work with AI coding
agents (Claude Code) on Unity projects: which rules the agent follows, which process it runs for
each kind of task, how sessions are tracked, and how the rules improve over time.

Project-specific knowledge — a project's own rules, system docs and analysis tools — lives in a
separate **host project layer** repository. For Magic Match 3D that is **TripleMatchAiMetaData**,
documented in its own page tree.

## Why this exists

Without guidance an agent guesses API signatures, drifts from our coding standards, skips
verification, and forgets everything between sessions. The framework fixes that with three
things:

- **Rules** — standards every generated line must meet (explicit types, Allman braces, no
  `ServiceLocator.Instance`, symmetric resource handling, project Logger only, and more).
- **Processes** — step-by-step workflows chosen by the kind of task: build a feature, fix a
  bug, make a small change, or investigate a question. Each has checkpoints where the engineer
  must confirm before the agent continues.
- **Feedback loop** — every session is measured (tokens, corrections, which rule files were
  actually loaded) and closed with a retrospective that proposes rule improvements.

## How it is organised

| Layer | Repository | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| **Core** (portable) | AIAgentCoreRules | Rules, Processes, Templates, Skills (slash commands), session-lifecycle tooling, this documentation |
| **Host project layer** | One per project — e.g. TripleMatchAiMetaData | Project rules, SystemIndex, Systems and SystemPatterns docs, Runnable analysis tools, project skills |

Both are linked into the game project under `GitIgnoredExternals/` and never committed to the
game repository.

The project's `CLAUDE.md` imports a small set of always-on files. Everything else is loaded
**on demand**: the agent classifies the task, then reads only the rule and process files that
task needs. This keeps the agent's context budget free for the actual work.

## How a session flows

1. **Start** — a SessionStart hook creates a tracking folder for the session automatically.
2. **Classify** — the agent picks a work mode (feature, bug fix, small task, investigation,
   other) and records it.
3. **Load** — it reads the process file for that mode and the rule files the work touches.
4. **Work** — it follows the process, stopping at each gate for engineer confirmation.
5. **Correct** — the engineer logs agent mistakes with `/inaccuracy` and deliberate changes
   of direction with `/iteration`.
6. **Close** — `/end-session` compiles metrics and writes a retrospective with proposed rule
   changes, which the engineer approves or rejects.
