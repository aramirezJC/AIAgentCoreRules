# Doc Review Tool

`Tools/doc-review/` previews a document and its Mermaid diagrams as a tabbed page on your own
machine and lets you comment on them before anything is published. Comments are stored next to
the doc, and the agent reads and answers them from the command line. Everything stays local:
the server listens on `127.0.0.1` only. Plain Python 3 (standard library only); marked, mermaid
and svg-pan-zoom load from CDNs in the browser.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `doc_review.py serve <doc.md> [<diagram.mmd>...] [--port N] [--open]` | Live server. One tab per file, live reload on save, in-page comments. Prints the URL |
| `doc_review.py serve <doc.md> ... --static [--output PATH] [--open]` | Writes a single HTML preview (default `_doc_review_preview.html` next to the doc). No server, no comments |
| `doc_review.py comments <doc.md> [--status open\|ready\|addressed\|resolved\|all] [--json]` | Lists comment threads resolved to `file:line`, plus inline `@CLAUDE:` markers. Text mode prints each thread's last reply (author and text) under it; `--json` carries `created_by`, the full `replies` list (author, text, at) and `follow_up`. A follow-up (the engineer replied after an agent reply) is selected by every `--status` filter, so a reply on an addressed thread still shows under `--status open` |
| `doc_review.py reply <doc.md> <thread_id> "<message>" [--status addressed]` | Adds an agent reply, optionally marking the thread addressed |
| `doc_review.py servers [--json]` | Lists the running live servers: pid, URL, doc and folder. Only the Python server process, not the shell that launched it |
| `doc_review.py stop [--port N \| --pid N \| --all]` | Stops a live server (SIGTERM). With no selector it stops the only one running and refuses when there are several. Used by `/kill-server` |
| `doc_review.py pr-notes <PR> [--repo-dir DIR] [--json]` | Prints a PR's conversation comments, review bodies and inline notes, oldest first, via `gh`. Used by `/feature-pr` |

`Tools/mermaid-preview/mermaid_preview.py` is the older entry point. It forwards to
`serve --static`.

## Commenting in the page

In live mode, select text in a Markdown tab or click a diagram node, edge or empty space to start
a comment. The sidebar groups threads as Drafts, Active, Orphaned (the anchored text or node is
gone) and Resolved. Each thread moves open → ready → addressed → resolved. The engineer marks a
thread ready for the agent, and the agent replies and marks it addressed. Threads live in
`<doc>.review.json` beside the doc. Unsent drafts survive a reload.

## Progress tab

When the served doc's folder contains a `<Name>_Progress.md` (a CreateFeature feature folder),
a **Progress** tab is added first, automatically. `/preview-feature <Name>` opens a feature this
way, with its TDD and diagrams:

- **Phases and steps.** Phases 1–8 and their gates come from `Processes/CreateFeature/index.md`.
  The steps are the `##` headings of each `Phase*.md` file.
- **Green ✓.** A phase is complete when the progress file has a gate handoff block for it, and
  then all its steps are checked. Steps of the current phase are checked when the checkpoint's
  `done` list mentions them. That match is approximate. A skipped phase stays unchecked even
  when later phases are done.
- **Development phases.** Each `### V<n> — …` heading under the TDD's `## Development plan`
  is listed under Phase 4 with two collapsibles. **Tasks** lists the rows of that phase's table
  as done (✓), partial (~) or not started (○), labelled by the Title column (else Task) with
  status from the Status column. It starts open for the first V-phase with unfinished tasks.
  **PR notes** lists the conversation comments, review bodies and inline comments of the PRs
  linked to that phase. Link them in the progress file:
  `pull_requests:` then `  V0: [9923, 9930]`. Notes are fetched with `gh` and refreshed every
  5 minutes. A gh failure shows as an error under that PR.
- **Task list.** When the TDD has no V-phases, tasks in `<Name>_TaskList.md` are listed under
  Phase 4 instead. Both task forms are read: the one-line `- {id:, status:, title:}` form and
  the multi-line `- task: "<text>"` form with an indented `status: "[x]"` line (no id).
- **Consistency findings.** Once the Gate 1 handoff block is written, its
  `consistency_findings` list (Sub-phase 1c's findings, each tagged ✅/⚠️/❌ with its outcome)
  is shown as a nested list under Phase 1's "Sub-phase 1c" step. Before that, or when the list
  is empty, the step shows nothing extra.
- **Current phase.** Highlighted in blue.
- **Gate to pass next, in red.** This is the current phase's gate until its handoff block is
  written, then the next unfinished phase's.

The tab refreshes whenever the progress file, the task list, the TDD or a CreateFeature phase
file changes, and every 5 minutes while PRs are linked. Static mode includes the tab without refreshing.

## Performance tab

When the project has tracked sessions (`GitIgnoreReports/Sessions/`, or `$SESSION_REPORTS_ROOT`),
a **Performance** tab is added last, on every served doc. It reads each session's `session.json`
breakdown: the same estimated token-by-category numbers the retrospective charts.

- **Overview.** Sessions, total tokens, average and median per session, standard deviation, and
  the standardized-operations share.
- **Bell curve.** A histogram of session totals with a normal curve fitted to log10(tokens). Totals
  span orders of magnitude, so the axis is logarithmic. One dot per session; the active one is yellow.
- **Tokens by category.** Total, average per session and share, across all sessions.
- **Doc review preview vs Miro/Confluence.** Tokens the `doc_review.py` / `mermaid_preview.py`
  calls cost, an estimate of the same operations through the Miro/Confluence MCP tools (serve ≈
  page update + diagram upload, comments ≈ comment fetches, reply ≈ comment post; per-call averages
  of real MCP calls, in `token_breakdown.MIRO_CONFLUENCE_BY_COMMAND`), and the measured cost of
  the Miro/Confluence MCP calls sessions really made. Each session lists its own line. Shown only
  once a breakdown compiled after this change has a preview or MCP call.
- **Sessions, newest first.** One collapsible each, with its category table. The active session
  (no `ended_at`, `session.json` written in the last hour) is highlighted and open.

Sessions without a compiled breakdown are listed but left out of the statistics. The tab
refreshes whenever a `session.json` changes; the active session is as fresh as its last compile
(the Stop hook recompiles after replies).

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s Tools/doc-review/tests -p 'test_*.py'
node Tools/doc-review/tests/smoke/review_ui_smoke.js   # needs Chrome + puppeteer in the npx cache
```
