description: Start Investigation Mode - a feasibility study, comparison, hypothetical refactor, "where does X happen" survey or design document; output is a document or recommendation, not code - without classifying the mode first. Use when the engineer runs /run-investigation-mode <question>.

# Run Investigation Mode

Paths are relative to the AIAgentCoreRules root (the parent of the `Rules/` folder that holds
MetaRouter.md). The engineer chose the lane, so skip MetaRouter's "Classify the Mode".

```yaml
steps:
  - "Step 0 — /start-session: if no 'Session tracking' block is in context, run: python3 Tools/session-lifecycle/session_lifecycle.py hook-start, and use the lifecycle script and session_id it prints below. If the engineer named the session, add --name \"<name>\" to the set."
  - "Run: python3 <lifecycle script> set --lane investigation --work-type question --title \"<short title from $ARGUMENTS>\"   # --work-type bug_fix when investigating a crash or defect"
  - "Read: Rules/InvestigationMode.md and follow it with $ARGUMENTS as the question."
  - "No arguments → ask for the question, then continue."
```

The output is a document or recommendation. If the answer is to build or fix something, offer
the lane change (`/small-task`, `/bug-fix`, `/feature`) — do not start writing code.
