"""Find the host project's root — shared by install.py and session_lifecycle.py, so the installer
and the session tracker always agree on it. No per-project configuration: git knows the root.

    find_project_root(start)   the main checkout (shared by every worktree): where reports live
    find_working_root(start)   the checkout `start` is in (a worktree when inside one)

Both fall back to the nearest ancestor holding CLAUDE.md for a project without git, and return
None when neither is found. Never derive a root from a shell's cwd without one of these: the
agent's `cd` moves the cwd, and a root built from it nests GitIgnoreReports inside itself.

A path inside <project>/GitIgnoredExternals/<layer> resolves to <project>: each layer is a
symlinked repo of its own, so git alone would answer with the layer. Pass logical paths
(logical_cwd(), a script's abspath) — os.getcwd() has already resolved the symlink away.
